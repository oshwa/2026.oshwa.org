The OSH Vacuum project brings the OSH perspective to a ubiquitous household product and end consumers. The design blends 3D-printable components and COTS parts with standardized mechanical and electrical interfaces, enabling customization and repair across diverse contexts. The first OSH Vacuum you buy will also be your last - it is built to last forever.
