Long before open source had a name, knitting machine communities were living its values by sharing hardware mods, reverse-engineering mechanisms, and keeping discontinued machines alive through collective information exchange. This talk explores how these crafters built a grassroots culture of repair, adaptation, and knowledge-sharing that predates and mirrors modern open-source hardware philosophy.
