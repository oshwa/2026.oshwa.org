Managing complex hardware as a hobbyist is difficult. The ZEReader project uses a software-first workflow, leveraging Zephyr and modular design, to simplify bring-up and debugging. I will discuss using Git/CI for documentation traceability and share the practical challenges in KiCad that still limit seamless, agile hardware iteration.
