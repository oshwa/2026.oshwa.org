Circuit Necromancy examines one artist's practice of electrical salvage, reframing e-waste as a site for play, learning, and transformation. The talk explores where to source decommissioned electronics, what hazards lurk within decades-old equipment, and how to appreciate machines as malleable collaborators worthy of resuscitation.
