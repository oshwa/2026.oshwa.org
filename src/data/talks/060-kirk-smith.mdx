Proprietary, hard-to-recycle batteries hinder the energy transition. The Flow Battery Research Collective ([fbrc.dev](https://fbrc.dev)) develops open-source batteries for stationary storage, using materials like zinc, iodine, iron, and manganese. We'll discuss technical and economic challenges facing our progress and comment on the peculiarities of an open-source hardware project with chemical risks.
