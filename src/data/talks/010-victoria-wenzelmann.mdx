This talk introduces Maker Emergency Kits as an open source hardware approach linking resilient communication, distributed manufacturing, and disaster response. They are not pre-built solutions, but adaptable blueprints for local production. Framed as open infrastructure within a global maker network, they support rapid, community-led fabrication of critical tools, during crises.
