Gather together to discuss **manufacturing**.

<LightningTalk title="Why manufacturing needs to change and become more open">
    Manufacturing is usually framed economically, but it's central to urban sustainability. LAUDS (Local, Accessible, Urban, Digital, Sustainable), developed in an EU-funded project, helps city manufacturers transform production, collaboration, and local value creation. It offers tools for data sharing and participation, lowering barriers to digital and open practices for resilient manufacturing.
