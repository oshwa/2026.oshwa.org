Build a contactless bicycle dynamo and light — no batteries, no wheel contact required! Using a physics phenomenon called eddy currents, your wheel's spin generates enough electricity to power a bike light. We'll learn how it works, then assemble our own dynamo and light from a kit. Open-source and beginner-friendly!

    William Kennedy makes lamps, light installations, and noise out of whatever he can find. Based in Los Angeles, Kennedy scavenges discarded objects and has repurposed them into over 100 original light objects through his studio Freakylamps. He has designed sets for touring musicians, built public art, played synthesizers in bands, and cycled across multiple continents.
