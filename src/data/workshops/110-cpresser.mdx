Together we will learn to make a simple PCB with KiCad. Bring your own computer with KiCad 10 installed, if possible also bring a mouse. The focus will be on the usage of the software and its concepts, we don't have the time to also go into the details of electronic design. At the end you will have made a PCB Design that is ready for fabrication.
