We will program a butterfly-shaped RP2040 PCB with NeoPixel LEDs and an IR transceiver, then watch our wearables "talk" to each other in the room! 🦋 We'll blend embedded programming fundamentals with creative expression, using a swarm effect as a metaphor for open-source community and collaborative making.
