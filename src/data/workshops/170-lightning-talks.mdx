Join us for short but sweet talks!

<LightningTalk title="Open Hardware Success by Surprise">
    My most successful and widespread Open Hardware project did so without me knowing it was happening. I'll tell the story of how a video game accessory I developed for a friend, came back into my life in a few unexpected ways.

    <Presenter name="Randy Glenn">
        Randy Glenn is a firmware developer from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Outside of work, his projects have included an open source pinball electronics system, and a physical vending machine for digital files. He is currently working on open-source motherboard designs for retrocomputers.

<LightningTalk title="SAO Gotchas">
    A short journey through designing a Simple Add-On (SAO), from concept to finished PCB. We'll explore what designs work well, open-source tools, real manufacturing results, power and component choices, and practical sizing. Finally, we'll discuss whether an SAO should double as a soldering kit—and for whom it makes sense.

    <Presenter name="Boris Nimcevic">
        Boris is a Stockholm-based Serbian electronics engineer and maker who began his career bringing playful ideas to life through toy engineering. He has since worked in educational technology and IoT, and enjoys exploring diverse crafts while creating spaces and communities where others can learn, build, and practice hands-on skills.

<LightningTalk title="ReMaking with 3DPrinter parts">
    The Bambu Lab Era is making older 3D printers "obsolete," but unlike closed-source proprietary junk, these aren't e-waste. Because they're mostly open hardware, they are goldmines of reusable parts. Inside every dusty 3d printer are stepper motors, bearings, rails, belts, rods, controllers, and switches. Standard parts that projects like BrailleRAP, ReCreator, and Artme3D use to turn "junk" into meaningful tools. Let's harvest, not discard.

    <Presenter name="Saad Chinoy">
        Saad Chinoy is a Singapore-based "Chief Geek" and maker at SpudnikLab and SalvageGarden. Focused on frugal innovation and assistive tech, he adapts open-source hardware like the BrailleRap for community impact across Asia. An advisor to GIG and r0g_agency, Saad champions e-waste repurposing and collaborative design to bridge the digital divide.

<LightningTalk title="Circuits to Graphics: Hardware Interfaces for Visual Systems">
    What visual possibilities do we unlock by replacing design software with commonplace hardware? The answer could lie somewhere between wiring up a simple joystick to inform real-time graphics and letting a basic potentiometer shape typographic letterforms. While the crossover between graphic design and physical circuitry remains largely experimental, it stands testament to how novel processes can lead to novel outcomes for both domains.

    <Presenter name="Shristi Singh">
        Shristi Singh is a new media artist born in Bombay, based in Brooklyn. She channels friendly technologies into her work, creating tools that people can create with. Her practice explores the technology of language—visual, written, and programmed. They come together in meaningful ways, from handmade poetic websites to playful learning interfaces and DIY hardware circuits. All in the service of people, participation, and purpose.
