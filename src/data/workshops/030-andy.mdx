In the one-hour daytime workshop participants can join to build some Mothboxes (https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/) together along with standalone insect attracting lights ("Mothbeams"). Participants who want to keep their Mothbox or Mothbeam can pay for materials ahead of time (~$370USD Mothbox / ~$20USD Mothbeam), but we should have some materials for those who just want to build and use. We will also spend the last 20 minutes of the workshop looking at the post-processing of insect data, and ways to visualize it.

    Dr. Andy Quitmeyer designs new ways to interact with the natural world. Quitmeyer has worked with large organizations like Cartoon Network, IDEO, and the Smithsonian, taught as a tenure-track professor, and even had his research turned into a (silly) television series called "Hacking the Wild." distributed by Discovery.

    He spends most of his time volunteering with smaller organizations and communities, and recently founded the    field-station/makerspace, Digital Naturalism Laboratories. In the rainforest of Gamboa, Panama, Dinalab blends biological fieldwork and technological crafting with a community of local and international scientists, artists and engineers.
