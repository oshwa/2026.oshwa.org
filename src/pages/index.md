## About OHS

Since 2010, the [Open Source Hardware Association][OSHWA], a 501(c)(3) not for profit charity, has hosted the **Open Hardware Summit**- a comprehensive conference for the open hardware community and the ever changing open source hardware movement.

[OSHWA]: https://www.oshwa.org/

Speakers include world renowned leaders from industry, academia, the
arts and maker community. Talks cover a wide range of subjects from
electronics, mechanics to related fields such as digital
fabrication, fashion technology, self-quantification devices, and IP
law. As a microcosm of the Open Source Hardware community, the Open
Hardware Summit provides an annual, friendly forum for the
community.

Our international event usually has around 300 attendees from around
the world, you can find past schedules [here][2025], [here][2024], and [here][2023] (and for the past 10+ years).
