# Fellowship

The Summit Fellowship was founded in 2013 prior to the annual Open Hardware Summit at MIT by Summit Chair [Addie Wagenknecht](http://placesiveneverbeen.com/) and OSHWA Director [Alicia Gibb](http://aliciagibb.com/) as a way to encourage marginalized people in open technology and culture to actively participate and foster a more diverse community within open source. By offering the annual travel and summit conference assistance to community members, the Open Source Hardware Association hopes we as a community can encourage more women, nonbinary, trans, LGBTQA+, Black, Indigenous, people of color and disabled people to participate in open source. We have many strong leaders and speakers in our field and we personally want to continue the trend upward.

For the thirteenth year, we are excited to offer up **Open Hardware Fellowships** to ten members of the community which includes a stipend, entrance to the Open Hardware Summit and mentorship opportunities leading up to the event.

Fellowship applications are officially open! You can self-nominate for the Summit Fellowship through [this form] (https://forms.gle/WFKaiJfnQACwuD7D8). The application is open until December 21st 2025 at 11pm EDT.
